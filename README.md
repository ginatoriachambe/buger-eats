# buger-eats

Buger eats is a project that use cypress to test a Brazilian Web Application called "BugerEats" made to manage food deliveryman. I created this project following the Cypress course
from QANinja taught by Fernando Papito.
The goal was to improve the way I created projects for cypress. Before taking this course I created and organized projects taking into account the basic configuration that is taught in the cypress documentation. This way of working led me to several difficulties such as code repetition, I spent too much time writing code both when creating and updating test cases, and I had difficulty solving bugs because the code was long.

Through my research and connections on linkedin, I discovered QANinjas which is a platform that provides training aimed at qas.

And I am happy to have successfully completed this course and to have achieved all the goals I had when looking for solutions to solve my problem.

After successfully completing the course, today I can create more organized projects with cypress, I can make the code more and more reusable, which helps me save the time I need to analyze new possible test cases.
